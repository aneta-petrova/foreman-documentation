= Disaster recovery with active and passive {ProjectServer} and backup and restore

In this scenario, you maintain two {ProjectServer}s, periodically taking backups of the primary active server and restoring them on the secondary passive server.
If the primary server fails, you turn the secondary server into your new primary server.
