= Recovering from disaster with active and passive server and backup and restore

If your active {ProjectServer} fails, activate your passive secondary server.

.Procedure
. Verify that the failed active server is powered off and the periodic synchronization of backups to your passive server is disabled.
// Is foreman-maintain service stop enough?
. Switch DNS records of the active server with the DNS records of the passive server.
This ensures that hosts remain connected and you do not need to re-register them.
. Assess the functionality of your new active {ProjectServer}.
See xref:Retrieving_the_Status_of_Services_{context}[].
// What about the old active server? Does it make sense to troubleshoot it and try to bring it back?
