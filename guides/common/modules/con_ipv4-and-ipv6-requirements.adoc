= IPv4 and IPv6 requirements

You can install {Project} in an IPv4 network or in an IPv6 network.

[NOTE]
====
Dual-stack {Project} installation that uses both IPv4 and IPv6 is not supported.

endif::[]

The following requirements apply to installations in an IPv4 network:

* An IPv6 loopback must be configured on the base system.
The loopback is typically configured by default.
Do not disable it.
* Do not disable IPv6 in kernel by adding the `ipv6.disable=1` kernel parameter.

For a supported way to disable the IPv6 protocol, see link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5045841[How do I disable the IPv6 protocol on Red Hat Satellite and/or Red Hat Capsule server?] in Red{nbsp}Hat Knowledgebase.
endif::[]

The following requirements apply to installations in an IPv6 network:

* If you intend to use {Project} to provision hosts, you must deploy an external DHCPv6 server and configure it manually to communicate with the network boot process and to manage IP address assignment because {Project} cannot integrate with a DHCPv6 server and manage its configuration.
For more information about DHCPv6 server configuration, see {ProvisioningDocURL}options-in-unmanaged-dhcpv6[Options in unmanaged DHCPv6] in _{ProvisioningDocTitle}_.
ifdef::satellite[]
* You must deploy an external HTTP proxy server that supports both IPv4 and IPv6.
This is required because Red Hat Content Delivery Network distributes content only over IPv4 networks, therefore you must use this proxy to pull content into the {Project} on your IPv6 network.
You must configure {Project} to use this dual-stack (supporting both IPv4 and IPv6) HTTP proxy server as the default proxy.
endif::[]
ifndef::satellite[]
* Optional: If you rely on content from IPv4-only networks and are deployed on IPv6-only, you can use an external dual stack HTTP proxy server.
In this setup, you must configure {Project} to use this dual-stack (supporting both IPv4 and IPv6) HTTP proxy server as the default proxy.
endif::[]

For more information, see {InstallingServerDocURL}adding-a-default-http-proxy_{project-context}[Adding a Default HTTP Proxy to {Project}].

Although {Project} provisioning templates include IPv6 support for PXE and HTTP (iPXE) provisioning, the only tested and certified provisioning workflow is the UEFI HTTP Boot provisioning.
This limitation only relates to users who plan to use {Project} to provision hosts.

.Additional resources
* To provision hosts in an IPv6 network, after installing {Project}, you must also configure {Project} for the UEFI HTTP boot provisioning.
