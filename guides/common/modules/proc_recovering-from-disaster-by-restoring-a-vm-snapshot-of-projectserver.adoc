= Recovering from disaster by restoring a VM snapshot of {ProjectServer}

In case of a disaster, use a virtual machine (VM) snapshot of your {ProjectServer} to restore {Project} services.

include::snip_disaster-recovery-hostname-cannot-change.adoc[]

.Procedure
. Identify the snapshot from which you want to recover.
. Use hypervisor tools to restore from the selected snapshot.
. Update DNS records so that the {ProjectServer} hostname resolves to the new IP address.
This redirects traffic from the old server to the new server and you will not need to re-register your hosts.

.Verification
* Assess the functionality of your restored {ProjectServer}.
// How can users verify that restoring to production was successful? A series of specific instructions would be best.
