== Headline Features

=== Remote execution in pull mode is now compatible with clients running `yggdrasil` versions 0.2.z and 0.4.z

The remote execution pull provider has been updated to be compatible with all versions of the `yggdrasil` package that can be installed on a host. As a result, remote execution jobs in pull mode work on Foreman hosts that run any of the currently supported versions of EL. This applies also to hosts with the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) repository enabled.

The pull-based transport mode relies on the Yggdrasil service and requires different Yggdrasil configuration based on the version of the `yggdrasil` package that is installed on the host. If weak dependencies are enabled on your hosts, the Yggdrasil client configuration is automatically updated and no further steps are required. If weak dependencies are disabled on your hosts, you must install the `foreman_ygg_migration` package manually to ensure that the Yggdrasil client configuration is updated. For detailed instructions, see link:https://docs.theforeman.org/3.14/Managing_Hosts/index-katello.html#troubleshooting-remote-jobs-timing-out-after-yggdrasil-update[Troubleshooting: Remote jobs timing out after yggdrasil update] in _{ManagingHostsDocTitle}_.
